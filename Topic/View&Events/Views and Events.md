During the Second World War(WWII), the Japanese committed numbers of monstrous and appalling(*very unpleasant and shocking*) crimes against humanity in Asia,such as the imposing of sex slavery, massacres(*when a lot of people are killed violently, especially people who cannot defend themselves*) in various places, abuse of labor and prisoners, performing both grisly(*extremely unpleasant and involving people being killed or injured*) and lethal human experiments.  

Today, some Japanese right-wing extremists still feny such facts, and the government they control does not make a sincere and official apology to the Asian people so far.  
There is so much evidence that can prove the aforementioned crimes in China, Korea, and southern of Asia, etc.

There are two sides to every coins. In other words, each objects has both positive parts and negative parts.

Some argue that few things only have benefits without a bad side, a good example of which is money. Admittedly, wealth can solve many problems, and make life smoother and satisfying, yet povety disrupts everything in life. However, people with great wealth tend to indulge in excess, become increasingly void and anxious, easily exposed to wrangle, robbery and kidnapped. Under such circustances, once they lose the money, they lose everything. Besides, rich people do not seem happier than the poor.

Others think that some things are merely harmful without a good side, such as drugs. Actually, only when drugs are abused, do they make people addicted, damage their health, and ruin the harmony of family, society and country. Moderate consumption of drugs, like coffeine, can increase alterness and memory temporarily, improve mood and performance, and ease pain, which is necessary for patients at death's door. From the point of plants, addictive components can help to paralyse pickers, spreed seeds and enlarge distribution by animals and human beings.

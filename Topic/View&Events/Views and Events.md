During the Second World War(WWII), the Japanese committed numbers of monstrous and appalling(*very unpleasant and shocking*) crimes against humanity in Asia,such as the imposing of sex slavery, massacres(*when a lot of people are killed violently, especially people who cannot defend themselves*) in various places, abuse of labor and prisoners, performing both grisly(*extremely unpleasant and involving people being killed or injured*) and lethal human experiments.  

Today, some Japanese right-wing extremists still feny such facts, and the government they control does not make a sincere and official apology to the Asian people so far.  
There is so much evidence that can prove the aforementioned crimes in China, Korea, and southern of Asia, etc.

## There are two sides to every coin

There are two sides to every coins. In other words, each objects has both positive parts and negative parts.

Some argue that few things only have benefits without a bad side, a good example of which is money. Admittedly, wealth can solve many problems, and make life smoother and satisfying, yet povety disrupts everything in life. However, people with great wealth tend to indulge in excess, become increasingly void and anxious, easily exposed to wrangle, robbery and kidnapped. Under such circustances, once they lose the money, they lose everything. Besides, rich people do not seem happier than the poor.

Others think that some things are merely harmful without a good side, such as drugs. Actually, only when drugs are abused, do they make people addicted, damage their health, and ruin the harmony of family, society and country. Moderate consumption of drugs, like coffeine, can increase alterness and memory temporarily, improve mood and performance, and ease pain, which is necessary for patients at death's door. From the point of plants, addictive components can help to paralyse pickers, spreed seeds and enlarge distribution by animals and human beings.

Undoubtedly, slavery is an absolutely infamous(~~notorious~~) system during the history of human development. Becoming a slave means the loss(~~lost~~) of freedom, considered as a tool instead of a human. Besides, high intensive labor(~~s~~) and horrible living condition(~~environment~~), slaves are abused and exploited recklessly in **both** mind and body, and even could be killed, displosed(~~deposed~~, disposed处置, deposed罢黜) and sold randomly by slaveholders. One known slavery history is the trade and system of the black slaves in America. Over ten million of(~~hundreds of millions of~~) black people were transported(~~transferred~~) from Africa to America and imposed to be slaves, most of whom died in transmit or labor sadly(*from wikipedia*).

Slavery is anti-humanity, but still inevitable and efficient at some time(~~at one time~~). Take American Slavery aforementioned as an example. According to "Slavery and Time on the Cross" by Robert Fogal and Stanley Engerman(*from Wikipedia*), the system of slavery was profitable for slave-owners due to their "rational" organization of plantation production to maximize their profits. And **S**outhern slave farms were more productive per unit of labor than Northern farms. which led to the Southern economy(~~economic~~) increased faster than the **N**orth. Therefore, Slavery in Southern American was not quickly going away on its own, just as in other civilizations.

## Should public emotion dictate the government policy?

The issue **on** public emotion should dictate(命令, 使听命) the government or not deserves to be discussed (~~and thought~~) deeply.

Nowadays, with the exception of very few nations like North Korea, even most of authoritarian countries declare that the governments represent the interests of the most numerous people, needless to say democratic countries of which the authorities are elected by voters. Undoutedly, the public have **the** right to influence the policy (~~and the enactment~~) and the government should listen to the public. Otherwise, there would be riot**s** and rebellion against governments.

On the other hand, public emtion could not and should not dictate the government policy. Puliv emtion differs usually. If government follows one group of people's emtion, they will certainly go against the another(~~other~~) group. So it seems unpractical for the public to reach a consensus and dictate the government policy.

And meeting the public demands blindly will lead to populism, and profoundly negative impacts on a country. Besides, the reasons of voters to vote or the superior to designate you are that they believe your political views and claims and the capacity of giverning. The government policy changes easily along with the unstable and fluctuant pulic emtion, why not we govern by ourselves,but elect you yo do that?

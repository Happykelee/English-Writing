Among many excellent authors around the world, my favorite person is Long Yingtai, a female writer in the region of Taiwan.
The themes of her books are diverse，ranging from nation and country to family and life.

One reason I respect her is that Long has considerable insight and the strong sense of justice and courage to say something other people not dare to do.
Take the book named *the Wild Fire* for example, it revealsed social, political and educational issues of Taiwan, and the shortages of Chinese people, which absolutely inspired the reform in Taiwan.

Another reason is that, apart from concerning about about the future of her homeland, she still paid great attention to her life and families. I think, *the seeing off* is the master work in such topic, which deeply expose the relationship between mother and son, daughter  and father, brother and sister.

The celebrity I most adore is Jin Xing, a famous Chinese dancer and the hostess of talk show.

One reason I like her is that she is such woman with great personality and having her own ideas. Once determined, she would never change her mind. In 1996, she had an operation to change her gender(sexuality) from male to female.

Aother reason is that she hs considerable insight and strong courage to reveal some hidden-rules in her talk show, which other people did not dare to do.

That is why I admire Jin Xing very much.

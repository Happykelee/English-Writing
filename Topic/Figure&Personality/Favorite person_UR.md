Among many excellent authors around the world, my favorite person is Long Yingtai, a female writer in the region of Taiwan.
The themes of her books are diverse，ranging from nation and country to family and life.

One reason I respect her is that Long has considerable insight and the strong sense of justice and courage to say something other people not dare to do.
Take the book named *the Wild Fire* for example, it revealsed social, political and educational issues of Taiwan, and the shortages of Chinese people, which absolutely inspired the reform in Taiwan.

Another reason is that, apart from concerning about about the future of her homeland, she still paid great attention to her life and families. I think, *the seeing off* is the master work in such topic, which deeply expose the relationship between mother and son, daughter  and father, brother and sister.

The celebrity I most adore is Jin Xing, a famous Chinese dancer and the hostess of talk show.

One reason I like her is that she is such woman with great personality and having her own ideas. Once determined, she would never change her mind. In 1996, she had an operation to change her gender(sexuality) from male to female.

Aother reason is that she hs considerable insight and strong courage to reveal some hidden-rules in her talk show, which other people did not dare to do.

That is why I admire Jin Xing very much.

## Explorer - Dias

In the long history of humanity, there are so many explorers with the spirit of ambition and adventure around the world. The most impressive one for me is Bartholmeu Dias, a famous Portuguese maritime explorer in the fifteenth century. His biggest discovery was to find the Cape of Good Hope in Africa. In 1487, Dias was designated to explore the southernmost point of Africa by the king of Portugal John II. He and his sailors set off in August, going alongeside the southwest coast to the south. Going through difficulties and obstacles, such as heavy storms, they gradually lost the location of where they were. By virtue of Dias' talent and insight, the expedition realized that they sailed over the southernmost point and turned north timely. Finally, they landed in Mossel Bay and rounded the Cape of Good Hope, which was named originally the Cape of Storms by Dias at that time, then changed into its currently known name by the king.

His discovery made a long-held dream of European navigators come ture, and proved the connection between the Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean.

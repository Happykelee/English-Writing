Obviously, to be a good leader should hav some characteristics.

In my view, one of the most important characteristics is perseverance. It is quite common to encounter difficulties over the course of a project, and if you give up easily when facing trouble, the group you lead will never achieve any goal.

Another fundamental quality is having good temper. You have to face various trival matters(sometimes even out of work) from your co-workers. If you lost patience and are unwilling to handle these matters, it will be hard for you to earn respect and trust.

Undoutedly, to be a good teacher quite needs some important characteristics.

One: to treat students equally without bias and prejudice. Only then will students feel self-confident and respect teacher sincerely.  
Two: should take care of students thoughtfully and patiently. When contacting with students, teachers will face various trouble and lose temper easily.  
Three: teach students in accordance of their aptitude. Teaching students with the same methods is like producing in the assembly lines, which must kill their curiosity, spontaneity(*the quality of being spontaneous and coming from natural feelings without constraint*) and innocence.
